## MRT Roadmap

Here is what is being planned for the future of Material React Table.

### Version 2 Roadmap (August 2024)

Version 2 development is finished, and now only the future versions of MRT are being worked on.

### Version 3 Roadmap (2024)

Material React Table Version 3 is being worked on to support the release of Material UI V6. MRT V3 will be a smaller upgrade that will create an easier target for anyone to easily upgrade to Material UI V6 and MRT V3.

### Beyond Version 3 (2025 and Beyond)

The future versions of Material React Table will include much bigger upgrades and changes. These changes may come in MRT V4 or later.

- Remove all Emotion dependencies and replace them with Pigment CSS. (Better performance and slightly smaller bundle size)
- Upgrade to Material UI V7 when it comes out.
- Upgrade to TanStack Table V9 and rewrite MRT to have more modular options. (Big changes for massive decrease in bundle size, but old way of using MRT will still be supported)
- Add Joy and Base UI adapters.

#### 3. Mantine React Table

Material React Table's sister library,[ Mantine React Table](https://mantine-react-table.com), continues to be developed in parallel, as it is nearing a stable V2 release itself. If you like MRT, but prefer to write pure CSS/CSS Modules instead of styled components or the `sx` prop, you'll probably like Mantine React Table more than Material React Table.
